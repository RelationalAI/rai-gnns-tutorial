## ðŸ“ˆ MLflow

If desired, you can visit [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to monitor the training process in real time, including loss trends and evaluation metrics. For a detailed guide on how to use MLflow with the RelationalAI Native App, refer to the [instructions](/Docs/MLflow.md) here.

To access the MLflow page, inside a Snowflake notebook you can run:

```python
connector.mlflow_session_url
```

This will return a URL that you can use to access the MLflow page, where you'll authenticate with your Snowflake credentials.

Upon opening MLflow, you will see two main tabs: the **Experiments** tab and the **Models** tab. The **Experiments** tab displays a list of all your experiments on the left side. By selecting your current experiment `HM_Dataset/binary_classification/Churn`, you will see all models trained under that experiment listed on the main page, as shown in Figure 1 below.

Clicking on a specific model (here `crawling-mole-592`) will direct you to its detailed page, where you can track its progress.
If the model is still training, the `Overview` tab will indicate that its Status is `Running`, like shown in the Figure 2 below.

To analyze a model's  performance metrics in real time, navigate to the **Model Metrics** tab, where you can see key training statistics such as **training loss**, **validation loss**, **evaluation metrics**, and **learning rate** updates. These metrics are continuously updated as training progresses, allowing you to track improvements and detect any potential issues. Here is a figure showcasing an example of an MLFLow experiment metric tracking where we trained the model for 4 epochs:

As shown in the figure, there are several key metrics displayed during the model training process that can help you evaluate the model's performance:
* `train_loss`: This plot shows how the model's error decreases over time on the training data, indicating its progress in learning. A decreasing train loss signifies that the model is improving its ability to predict the training data.
* `val_loss`: Tracks the model's error on unseen validation data. This helps in detecting overfittingâ€”if the validation loss starts to increase while the train loss continues to decrease, it may indicate the model is memorizing the training data rather than generalizing well.
* `train_metric_average_precision`: This measures how well the model correctly classifies the training data, reflecting its learning efficiency.
* `val_metric_average_precision`: This evaluates how well the model performs on unseen validation data, giving insight into its generalization ability.

After training multiple models, once you have identified a **satisfactory** one, you can proceed with **registering it for future use**. After registering it, you can perform inference on new, unseen data with this model refering to it by its **name** and **version**. So, to register a model, first navigate to its page by selecting the appropriate experiment (here: `HM_Dataset/binary_classification/Churn`) and then the model within the Experiments tab. Once on the modelâ€™s page, click the **"Register Model"** button, located in the top-right corner, as shown in Figure 4.

You will then be presented with two options. The first option allows you to create a new model by clicking on **"+ Create New Model"**, where you can specify a **custom name** for it:

<p align="center"><em>Figure 5: Click on Create New Model.</em></p>

</p>
<p align="center"><em>Figure 6: Enter a custom name to specify your model.</em></p>

The second option lets you register the model **as a new version of an existing registered model**, in which case the newly trained model will be added as a version update to the selected model. After selecting the appropriate option, click **"Register"** to finalize the process.

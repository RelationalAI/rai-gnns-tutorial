# Running the H&M Use Cases

The [GNN Tutorial: H&M Dataset](hm.md) guide describes the two use cases on the H&M data:

* Churn task: Predict whether a customer is going to churn or not during the next month.
* Purchase task: Recommend items for purchase to the user.

To set up all the necessary data, tables, schemas, etc. for the use cases you will need to go through the [installation guide](installation.md). Once this is completed you are able to run the Python Notebooks that were installed as part of the process.
